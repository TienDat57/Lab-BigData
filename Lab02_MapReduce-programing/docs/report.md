## Explain the code in detail.
### Problem 1: WordCount
#### Mapper
```java
public static class WordCountMapper extends Mapper<Object, Text, Text, IntWritable>{
    private final static IntWritable number = new IntWritable(1);
    private Text word = new Text();
    public void map(Object key, Text value, Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
        StringTokenizer token = new StringTokenizer(value.toString());
        while (token.hasMoreTokens()) {
            word.set(token.nextToken());
            context.write(word, number);
        }
    }
}
```
- The mapper class is a subclass of the Mapper class. 
- 2 variables are declared: 
    - `number` is a constant variable with value 1 to count the number of words.
    - `word` is a variable of type Text to store the word. 
- Idea of the mapper class: 
    - The mapper class will read the input file line by line. 
    - Then, the mapper class will split the line into words by using the `StringTokenizer` class. 
    - After that, the mapper class will loop through the words and write the word and the number 1 to the context.
    - The context will be used to write the output file.
  
#### Reducer
```java
public static class WordCountReducer extends Reducer<Text,IntWritable,Text,IntWritable> {
    private IntWritable result = new IntWritable();

    public void reduce(Text key, Iterable<IntWritable> values, Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
        int sum = 0;
        for (IntWritable val : values) {
            sum += val.get();
        }
        result.set(sum);
        context.write(key, result);
    }
}
```
- The reducer class is a subclass of the Reducer class to reduce the output of the mapper class.
- 1 variable is declared: 
    - `result` is a variable of type IntWritable to store the number of words is counted.
- Idea of the reducer class: 
    - The reducer class will read the output file of the mapper class line by line. 
    - Then, the reducer class will split the line into words and the number of words by using the `StringTokenizer` class. 
    - After that, initialize the variable `sum` to 0. This variable is used to count the number of words. 
    - The reducer class will loop through the words and count the number of words by using the variable `sum`.
    - Finally, set the value of the variable `result` to `sum` and write the word and the number of words to the context.

#### Guide to run the program   
- Step 1: Create file `WordCount.java` in the folder `src` of the project.
  
- Step 2: Create file `wordcount.txt` in the folder `data` of the project and then `put` the file to the local HDFS by using the command 
  ```
  hdfs dfs -mkdir /input
  ```
  ```
  hdfs dfs -put data/wordcount.txt /input
  ```

  ![Step 2](../docs/images/problem01/01_1.png)

- Step 3: Compile and run the program by using the command 
  - `javac` is a command-line tool that compiles Java source code into Java bytecode.
    ```
    hadoop com.sun.tools.javac.Main WordCount.java
    ```
  - `jar` is a command-line tool that creates a Java archive file (JAR) from a set of Java class files.
    ```
    jar cf wc.jar WordCount*.class
    ```
  - `hadoop` is a command-line tool that runs a MapReduce job.
      ```
      hadoop jar wc.jar WordCount /input /output
      ```

    ![Step 3](../docs/images/problem01/01_2.png)

- Step 4: Check the result by using the command
    
    ```
    hdfs dfs -cat /output/part-r-00000
    ```

    private IntWritable result = new IntWritable(); 

    public void reduce(IntWritable key, Iterable<Text> values,Context context)
      throws IOException,InterruptedException {
      int sum = 0;

      for(Text x: values)
      {
          sum += 1;
      }

      int sum = 0;
      for (Text val : values) {
        sum += Integer.parseInt(val.toString());
      }
      result.set(sum);
      context.write(key, result);
    }
}
```
